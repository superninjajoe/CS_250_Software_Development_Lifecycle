How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I would like to build a close relationship with the user to have open and clear communications to get a full understanding of what they are trying to accomplish. I would be able to build some User Stories from those conversations and further build upon some of them with focus groups. During the development cycle, I would like to provide feedback to them. They are free to let me know how the development is coming along and be able to provide their input on it. Being able to fully understand the user's wants and needs is vital to producing a product they will enjoy and be proud of. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I would like to approach it openly. I haven't been in a development role but I would certainly like to view the agile method in a real-world situation. Just being able to incorporate this in my current day-to-day life would be enjoyable, almost like practicing what I preach. If I do into a role that would incorporate this type of development, I would be open and eager to learn. I would do my best to be a team member and push the product forward. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I beleive being a good team member is having open communication. Being able to give useful feedback and be able to take in good criticism. Being supported is important since all team members play an equal and vital role. Being positive would assist others in feeling this way. Negative energy is non-useful energy. You will need to be there as a team for each other. Good team members work closely with each other to accomplish the goals as a team.
